# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to give a score of sentiment to a tweet using NLP methods and neural networks. This score can take 7 values defined as follow:

- 3: very positive emotional
- 2: moderately positive emotional
- 1: slightly positive emotional
- 0: neutral or mixed emotional
- -1: slightly negative emotional
- -2: moderately negative emotional
- -3: very negative emotional

For example, 

- a score of `3` should be return with a tweet like `"I found #marmite in Australia. :) #happy"`,
- a score of `-3` should be return with a tweet like `"I hate having ideas but being too afraid to share them ðŸ˜”"`.

The main issue is that there are very few tweets labeled at 7, but on the other hand there are a lot of tweets labeled at 3. So, a part of this project is to apply a transfere learning with a neural network trained with tweets labeled at 3 onto another neural network for tweets labeled at 7.

Others part of the project is to preprocess the tweets, produce word embeddings to have a strong representations of the language, add some data sources like `Emoji Valence` or `Opinion Lexicon English` sources in ordre to have more semantics in our vectors.

## Resume

This program has been developed with Python programming language.

The project contains:

* src folder containing the source files
* data folder containing
     * datasets for tweets
     * embedding matrix
* resources folder containing
    * EV source (emoji valence)
    * OLE source (opinion lexicon english)
* results where models and predictions are produced

## Installation

Go to `data/embedding/README.md` and follow the instruction.

## Execution

Run the Notebook `src/train.ipynb` into Jupyter and launch the cells. The results are produced into `results/`.
